# Acquiring Tasks

Here is a simplified screenshot of the task acquisition page on the Evaluation Platform. Please note that changes are sometimes made to the appearance of this page, so it may not look exactly as it appears below.

A few notes about how to acquire tasks from this page:

- rater@gmail.com: Make sure you are logged in to the account you used to sign up for the rating program.

- Acquire if available: Click this button to acquire a new task.

- Experimental: This text indicates that there is an Experimental task available.

Please note there are other types of rating tasks (e.g., Result Review, Side-by-Side). Sometimes there will be only one task type available, but other times you may see more than one type displayed. When there is more than one type displayed, you may choose the type you want to acquire.
