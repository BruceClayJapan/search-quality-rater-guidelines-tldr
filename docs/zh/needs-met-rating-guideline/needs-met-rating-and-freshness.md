# Needs Met Rating and Freshness

Some queries demand very recent or "fresh" information. Users may be looking for "breaking news," such as an important event or natural disaster happening right now. Here are different types of queries demanding current/recent results.

Type of Query Example Queries Explanation

"Breaking news" queries [tornado], [tsunami]

Assume users need the information right away.

Imagine someone who needs immediate weather information because a big storm is coming. Information about last year's weather would not be helpful.

Recurring event queries, such as elections, sports events, TV shows, conferences, etc.

[olympics], [american idol],
[redsox schedule], [tax forms],
[elections]

Assume users are looking for the most recent or current information about the event.

For example, if the Olympics are happening right now, users searching [olympics] want information about the current Olympics, not results from years ago. If the next Olympics are a few months away, users are probably interested in the upcoming Olympics.

Current information queries

[population of paris], [amount of u.s. debt], [airfare from ny to sfo],
[next federal holiday]

Assume users are looking for the most current information, such as prices or airfare.

Product queries [iphone], [toyota camry], [windows^
operating system]

Assume users are looking for information about the most recent model/version for these product queries.

When a query demands recent content, only pages with current, recent, or updated content should get high Needs Met ratings. For these queries, pages about past events, old product models and prices, outdated information, etc. are not helpful. They should be considered "stale" and given low Needs Met ratings. In some cases, stale results are useless and should be rated **FailsM**.

For some queries, there may be "newsy" or recent information user intent, as well as more "timeless" information user intent. Users issuing queries for celebrities or politicians may be interested in biographical information, or users may be looking for the latest news or gossip.

Freshness is generally less of a concern for E-A-T rating. "Stale" pages can have high E-A-T ratings. For example, some highly reputable news websites maintain "archival" content. However, unmaintained/abandoned "old" websites or unmaintained and inaccurate/misleading content is a reason for a low E-A-T rating.

**Note**: The date the page was created may be different from when the content was last updated or modified. When content is updated, the page will sometimes show the date of the update, not the date the page was created. Some websites always show the current date, regardless of when the content was last updated. If you are curious about the content of a page, see here to try the "Wayback Machine" on the Internet Archive. Not all pages are available, but this tool may help you understand how some pages were created and how their content has changed over time.
