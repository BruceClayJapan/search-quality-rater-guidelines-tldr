# Highest Quality Pages

**Highest** quality pages are created to serve a beneficial purpose and achieve their purpose very well. The distinction between **High** and **Highest** is based on the quality and quantity of MC, as well as the level of reputation and E-A-T.

What makes a page **Highest** quality? In addition to the attributes of a **High** quality page, a **Highest** quality page must have at least one of the following characteristics:

- *Very high level of Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-A-T).*
- A very satisfying amount of high or highest quality MC.
- Very positive website reputation for a website that is responsible for the MC on the page. Very positive reputation of the creator of the MC, if different from that of the website.

## Very High Quality MC

We will consider the MC of the page to be very high or highest quality when it is created with a high degree of time and effort, and in particular, expertise, talent, and skill—this may provide evidence for the E-A-T of the page. Very high quality MC may be created by experts, hobbyists, or even people with everyday expertise. Our standards depend on the purpose of the page and the type of content. However, for news articles and information pages on YMYL topics, there is a high standard for accuracy and well-established medical/scientific/historical consensus where such consensus exists. The **Highest** rating may be justified for pages with a satisfying or comprehensive amount of very high quality MC.

## Very Positive Reputation

Extensive reputation research is important when giving **Highest** ratings, and is evidence of the E-A-T of the page. Very positive reputation is often based on prestigious awards or recommendations from known experts or professional societies on the topic of the page. Wikipedia and other informational sources can be a good starting point for reputation research.

For some topics, such as humor or recipes, less formal expertise is OK. For these topics, popularity, user engagement, and user reviews can be considered evidence of reputation. For topics that need less formal expertise, websites can be considered to have a positive reputation if they are highly popular and well-loved for their topic or content type, and are focused on helping users.

## Very High Level of E-A-T

**Highest** quality pages and websites have a very high level of expertise or are highly authoritative or highly trustworthy.

Formal expertise is important for topics such as medical, financial, or legal advice. Expertise may be less formal for topics such as recipes or humor. An expert page on cooking may be a page on a professional chef’s website, or it may be someone who posts popular cooking videos on YouTube. Please value life experience and "everyday expertise." For some topics, the most expert sources of information are ordinary people sharing their life experiences on personal blogs, forums, reviews, discussions, etc.

Think about what expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness mean for the topic of the page. Who are the experts?
What makes a source trustworthy for the topic? What makes a website highly authoritative for the topic?
