# TL;DR for Designers

Here we summarize what to avoid when designing a site.

## What to Avoid

> - Websites and pages that are created with intent to harm users, **deceive users**, or make money with no attempt to help users, should receive the **Lowest** page quality rating.
> - Websites or pages without any beneficial purpose, including pages that are created with no attempt to help users, or pages that potentially spread hate, cause harm, or misinform or deceive users, should receive the **Lowest** rating.
> - Websites or pages without some sort of beneficial purpose, including pages that are created with no attempt to help users, or pages that potentially spread hate, cause harm, or misinform or deceive users, should receive the **Lowest** rating.
> - We will consider a page to be "deceptive" if it may deceive users or trick search engines. All deceptive pages should be rated **Lowest**.
> - Any page or website that may deceive or trick users should be rated **Lowest**, regardless of intent.

Listed above, Google mentions many times throughout their guidelines that pages attempting to deceive users or search engines should receive the **Lowest** quality score; they will not rank. As the web designer, there is only one thing you need to remember:

::: danger Do not deceive users

The following techniques can deceive users and should be avoided when designing a website:

- **Pages that disguise Ads as MC.** Actual MC may be minimal or created to encourage users to click on the Ads. For example, **fake search pages** ([like this one](https://guidelines.raterhub.com/images/PQ.2.3.16.jpg)) that have a list of links that look like a page of search results. If you click on a few of the links, you will see that the page is just a collection of Ads disguised as search engine results. A "search box" is present, but submitting a new query just gives you a different page of Ads disguised as search results.

  - [Ads disguised as main content: Example 3](https://guidelines.raterhub.com/images/PQ.2.6.5.jpg)

- **Pages that disguise Ads as website navigation links.** For example, **fake directory pages** ([like this one](https://guidelines.raterhub.com/images/PQ.2.1.15.jpg)) that look like a personally curated set of helpful links, possibly with unique descriptions. In reality, the links are Ads or links to other similar pages on the site. Sometimes the descriptions of the links are unrelated to the page.

- **Pages where the MC is not usable or visible.** For example, a page that has such a large amount of Ads at the top of the page (before the MC), so that most users will not see the MC, or a page where the MC is invisible text.
  - [Main content not visible on page load: Example 1](https://guidelines.raterhub.com/images/PQ.2.6.3.jpg)

- **Any page designed to trick users into clicking on Ads or other links** intended to serve the needs of the website rather than to the benefit of the user.
:::

Google lists other examples of webpages that are created with the intent to deceive users:

> - A webpage or website that impersonates a different site (e.g., copied logo or branding of an unaffiliated site, URL that mimics another site's name, etc.).
> - A non-satirical social network profile made by an impersonator.
> - A webpage or website that looks like a news source or information page, but in fact has articles to manipulate users in order to benefit a person, business, government, or other organization politically, monetarily, or otherwise.
> - A webpage claims to offer an independent review or share other information about a product, but is in fact created to make money for the owner of the website without attempting to help users. For example, the MC may contain intentionally misleading or inaccurate information created with the sole purpose of getting users to click on monetized links or buy the product.
> - A website claims to be the personal website of a celebrity, but the website is actually created to make money for the owner of the website without the permission of the celebrity. For example, the page may have false testimonials for a product and is created for the sole purpose of getting users to click on monetized links or buy the product.
> - A webpage with a misleading title or a title that has nothing to do with the content on the page. Users who come to the page expecting content related to the title will feel tricked or deceived.
> - A webpage or website with deceptive website information. For example, the website may misrepresent who owns the site, what the website purpose really is, how the content was created, how to contact the site, etc.

---

Google also mentions the following as something to avoid:

> - Pages with Ads, SC, or other features that distract from or interrupt the use of the MC should be given a **Low** [page quality] rating.

This leads us to a less troubling, but more common issue with a large portion of websites that depend on ads for income:

::: warning Do not distract users

The following can be truly distracting and make the MC difficult to use:

- Ads that are difficult to close
- Ads that follow page scrolls
- Interstitial pages that require an app download

:::

However, Google does mention that the following techniques are okay:

> - Interstitials that appear to be in response to a legal obligation, such as for cookie usage or for age verification.
> - Login dialogs on sites where content is not publicly indexable. For example, this would include private content such as email or unindexable content that is behind a paywall.
> - Banners that use a reasonable amount of screen space and are easily dismissible. For example, the app install banners provided by Safari and Chrome are examples of banners that use a reasonable amount of screen space.
