# Quality Rater Guidelines - Manager Takeaways

Here we try to keep things as concise as possible, informing you about what to check your site for and which team needs to handle the problem if it isn't obvious. Ironically, this is also the longest TL;DR, since a complete understanding is needed.

> Disclaimer: The following content includes opinions and reasoning from the SEO professionals at [Bruce Clay Japan Inc.](https://bruceclay.jpn.com) These opinions and suggestions attempt to summarize Google's Quality Rater Guidelines, but are **not in any way** endorsed or backed by Google.

## General Guidelines Overview

Within Google's search results, pages are ranked based on two things:

1. **quality** of their info
2. **how well they satisfy the user's intent**

## Understanding Webpages and Websites

### Webpages

::: tip
Every page you want to be ranked highly must be created with the intention of **helping users**.
:::

::: tip
Pages which could potentially impact the future happiness, health, financial stability, or safety of users (YMYL pages) are judged more strictly.
:::

Some examples:

- Shopping or financial transaction pages
- Financial information pages
- Medical information pages
- Legal information pages
- News articles or public/official information pages important for having an informed citizenry
- Child Adoption
- Car Safety Information
- etc.

#### Parts of a Webpage

**Main Content (MC)**
: Any content on the page that **directly helps the page achieve its purpose** (product details on a product page, ingredients/measurements/directions on a recipe page, etc.).

**Supplementary Content (SC)**
: Any content that **is not** considered MC or Ads, but **affects (positively or negatively) user experience** (navigation links, related products, spammy comments, etc.).

**Identifying Advertisements/Monetization (Ads)**
: Ads is content and/or links that are displayed for the purpose of **monetizing the page**.

### Websites

Google will judge the reputation of a website based on reputable independent sources (like [BBB](https://www.bbb.org/), [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/), etc.).

::: tip
Make it as easy as possible for Google to discover who (person/company) is responsible for the website, and who (person/company) created the content on any news/research/information-based pages.
:::  

This implies a more trustworthy website overall.

::: tip
Make sure your website has contact information.
:::

Depending on your type of business, Google expects different types and amounts of contact information. Contact information is very important for websites that handle money (stores, banks, credit card companies, etc.).

#### Contact Info Suggestions

- Shopping Websites
  - Office Address
  - Email address
  - Phone number
  - Payment Policy
  - Exchange Policy
  - Return Policy
- Humor/Entertainment Websites
  - Office Address
  - Email address
- Personal Blogs
  - Email address/no contact info

### Reputation of the Website or Creator of the Main Content

::: tip
Make sure your company is (or you are) responding to negative reviews and asking for reviews from satisfied customers.
:::

If your company has (or you have) a bad reputation online, Google will be among the first to know, and your site can benefit or suffer as a result. This information is gathered and analyzed from many sources, including but not limited to:

- news articles
- Wikipedia articles
- blog posts
- magazine articles
- forum discussions
- ratings from independent organizations
- customer reviews

> For small businesses, having no reputation online is okay, it will **not** negatively affect your site.
