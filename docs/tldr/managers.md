# Quality Rater Guidelines - Manager Takeaways

Here we try to keep things as concise as possible, informing you about what to check your site for, how it's affecting your bottom line, and which team needs to handle the problem. Ironically, this is also the longest TL;DR, since a complete understanding is needed.

## General Guidelines Overview

Within Google, search result pages are ranked based on two things:

- **quality** of their info and
- **how well they satisfy the user's intent**

## Understanding Webpages and Websites

### Webpages

Subdomains made for different purposes (like **finance**.yahoo.com and **sports**.yahoo.com) are considered to be separate websites.

Every page you want to be ranked highly must be created with the intention of **helping users**.

Pages which could potentially impact the future happiness, health, financial stability, or safety of users (YMYL pages) are judged more strictly. Some examples:

- Shopping or financial transaction pages
- Financial information pages
- Medical information pages
- Legal information pages
- News articles or public/official information pages important for having an informed citizenry
- Child Adoption
- Car Safety Information
- etc.

#### Google's Definitions

Main Content (MC)
:  Any content on the page that directly helps the page achieve its purpose (product details on a product page, ingredients/measurements/directions on a recipe page, etc.).

Supplementary Content (SC)
:  Any content that **is not** considered MC or Ads, but **improves** (or even **worsens**) user experience (navigation links, related products, spammy comments, etc.).

Identifying Advertisements/Monetization (Ads)
:  Ads is content and/or links that are displayed for the purpose of monetizing the page.
