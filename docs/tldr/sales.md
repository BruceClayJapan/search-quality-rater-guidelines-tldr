# Quality Rater Guidelines - Sales Takeaways

Here we summarize what to look for on a client's site, and how many man-hours certain problems will take to fix.

## Things to Look Out For

> Keep in mind that pages which could potentially impact the future happiness, health, financial stability, or safety of users are judged much more strictly. Some examples:
>
> - Shopping or financial transaction pages
> - Financial information pages
> - Medical information pages
> - Legal information pages
> - News articles or public/official information pages important for having an informed citizenry
> - Child Adoption
> - Car Safety Information
> - etc.
>
> Fixing issues on pages like these is a priority for the client.

- Deceptive ad placement on the pages `Fix time: < 1 day`
- Poor site reputation `Fix time: many months`
