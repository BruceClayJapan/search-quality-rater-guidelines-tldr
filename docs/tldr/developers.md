## Understanding Webpages and Websites

Subdomains made for different purposes (like **finance**.yahoo.com and **sports**.yahoo.com) are more likely to be considered separate websites.

Every page on the website must be created with the intention of **helping users**. Building pages to take advantage of users (deceptive ad placement, crypto mining) will negatively affect the site's rank.

Ensure that the `<h1>` tag on each page **accurately summarizes** the page's [main content](/qrg/page-quality-rating-guideline/2-understanding-webpages-and-websites.html#identifying-the-main-content-mc).

::: tip
Google uses the logo of a website (if it is hyperlinked) as a strong indicator of a website's home page.
:::

For example, if you have a blog/documentation/FAQs/etc. on a separate subdomain, with a website logo pointing to the home page of the separate subdomain, Google is more likely to treat your subdomain and main site as separate -- which is rarely desired.
