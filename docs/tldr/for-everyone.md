# Search Quality Rater Guidelines, TL;DR

Here we try to keep things as concise as possible, informing you about what to check your site for and which team needs to handle the problem if it isn't obvious.

<div class="note">

Disclaimer: The following content includes opinions and reasoning from the SEO professionals at [Bruce Clay Japan Inc.](https://bruceclay.jpn.com) These opinions and suggestions are an attempt to summarize Google's Quality Rater Guidelines, but are **not in any way** endorsed or backed by Google.

</div>

## General Guidelines Overview

Within Google's search results, pages are ranked based on two things:

1. **quality** of their info, and
2. **how well they satisfy the user's intent**

What percentage of users would your page satisfy?

## Understanding Webpages and Websites

### Webpages

If you want a page to be ranked highly in a given category, focus first and foremost on **helping users** (better than the competition).

::: tip Pages must have a helpful or beneficial purpose in order to rank.
 Helpful or beneficial page purposes include (but are not limited to):

- Sharing information about a topic.
- Sharing personal or social information.
- Sharing pictures, videos, or other forms of media.
- Expressing an opinion or point of view.
- Entertaining users.
- Selling products or services.
- Allowing users to post questions for other users to answer.
- Allowing users to share files or to download software.

:::

::: warning Your Money or Your Life (YMYL)
Pages which could potentially impact the future happiness, health, financial stability, or safety of users (YMYL pages) are judged more strictly.

Example YMYL pages:

- Shopping or financial transaction pages
- Financial information pages
- Medical information pages
- Legal information pages
- News articles or public/official information pages important for having an informed citizenry
- Child Adoption
- Car Safety Information
- etc.
:::

#### Parts of a Webpage

Some definitions from Google:

> **Main Content (MC)**
> : Any content on the page that **directly helps the page achieve its purpose** (product details on a product page, ingredients/measurements/directions on a recipe page, etc.).
>
> **Supplementary Content (SC)**
> : Any content that **is not** considered MC or Ads, but **[positively or negatively] affects user experience** (navigation links, related products, spammy comments, etc.).
>
> **Identifying Advertisements/Monetization (Ads)**
> : Any content and/or links that are displayed for the purpose of **monetizing the page**.

### Understanding Websites

Google makes note of when subdomains and root domains will likely be treated as separate entities (**emphasis** added):

> ...we will consider [the subdomain's top page] the homepage, rather than [the domain's top page]. Why? Because **clicking on the logo takes the user to [the subdomain's top page]**. In addition, [the subdomain's top page] has information about the [subdomain] website. It is **very difficult to find <span style="text-decoration: underline">specific</span> information about [the subdomain] on the [domain's] homepage**.

Google will judge the reputation of a website based on a range of reputable independent sources (sites like [BBB](https://www.bbb.org/), [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/), etc.).

::: tip Be trustworthy.
Make it as easy as possible for Google to discover who (person/company) is responsible for the website, and who (person/company) created the content, especially for news/research/information-based pages.

In general, this implies a more trustworthy website overall.
:::  

::: tip Include contact information and policies.
Depending on your type of business, Google expects different types and amounts of contact information and policies. This information is extremely important for any website that handles money (stores, banks, credit card companies, etc.).
:::

#### Contact Info Suggestions

- Shopping Websites
  - Office Address
  - Email address
  - Phone number
  - Payment Policy
  - Exchange Policy
  - Return Policy
- Humor/Entertainment Websites
  - Office Address
  - Email address
- Personal Blogs
  - Email address/no contact info

### Reputation of the Website or Creator of the Main Content

::: tip Maintain a good reputation.
Make sure your company is (or you are) asking for reviews from satisfied customers and responding to negative reviews.
:::

If your company has (or you have) a bad reputation online, Google will be among the first to know, and your site can suffer as a result. This information is gathered and analyzed from many sources, including but not limited to:

- news articles
- Wikipedia articles
- blog posts
- magazine articles
- forum discussions
- ratings from independent organizations
- customer reviews

<div class="note">

For small businesses, having no reputation online is okay, it will **not** negatively affect your site.

</div>

## Overall Page Quality Rating

::: danger Webpages with any of the following characteristics will rank poorly:

- Has no beneficial purpose
- Makes no attempt to help users
- Spreads hate
- Causes harm
- Contains misinformation
:::

Page Quality is mainly determined by these five things:

1. The page's purpose
2. **E**xpertise, **A**uthoritativeness, and **T**rustworthiness (E-A-T)
3. The quality and amount of the page's **main content**
4. Information about the company/person responsible for the **main content**
5. Reputation of the company/person responsible for the **main content**

For pages that have a beneficial purpose, E-A-T is:

- The **expertise of the creator** of the main content
- The **authoritativeness of the creator** of the main content, the **main content itself**, and the **website**.
- The **trustworthiness of the creator** of the main content, the **main content itself**, and the **website**.

### How to Evoke Expertise, Authority, and Trust

E-A-T is determined differently based on the topic(s) of your website. For guidance based on page and site

#### Medical Site

## High Quality Pages

::: tip Content created by known experts will rank higher.
Whether you're the expert or you hire the expert, make sure you attribute the content to the expert who created it.

  - The quality standards change depending on the **purpose of the page** and the **type of content**
- **Exceptionally** positive reputation for the person or company that created the content
  - Very positive reputation is often based on prestigious awards or recommendations from known experts or professional associations on the topic of the page

  The page or website has strong High quality rating characteristics along with some mild Low quality characteristics.

## Page Quality Rating Tasks

::: tip Maintain high Expertise, Authority, and Trust (E-A-T).
A page is judged on the reputation and E‑A‑T of **both the website and the creator(s)** of the MC. This is especially important when the page covers a YMYL topic.
:::

## Understanding Mobile Users, Mobile Queries, and Mobile Results

::: tip Design for mobile users.
Think about the mobile user when you are designing your site.

- Are forms easy to fill out on mobile?
- Is it easy to navigate the site on mobile?
- Are you answering/solving the mobile user's query as quickly as possible?
:::

::: tip Every user query has a goal.
The page that best answers a given query will rank highest. Keep the following in mind:

- The search intent for a given query can change over time (e.g. searching <span class="query">iphone</span> in 2007 vs today)
  - Older pages become less relevant over time
- Queries can have multiple meanings (e.g. <mark class="query">apple</mark>)
  - If the query has a dominant interpretation (in this case "Apple Inc."), pages related to that interpretation will rank highest
:::

## Rating Using the Needs Met Scale

Search results are ranked based on how well they fulfill a user's query.

### Fully Meets

<div class="note">

While fully meeting the needs of users is ideal, these types of queries and their keywords often do not require targeted optimization. We recommend focusing instead on [highly meeting](#highly-meets) queries.

</div>

A special category in which the search result is an exact and unique match for the query. For example, if somebody in Japan is searching for <mark class="query">Bruce Clay Japan home page</mark>, they are undoubtedly trying to get to [https://bruceclay.jpn.com/](https://bruceclay.jpn.com/).

This type of result is almost exclusively reserved for **Website** queries and **Know Simple** queries.

::: tip Characteristics of pages that fully satisfy a user's query:

- Your page can only "Fully Meet" a query that is specific, clear, and unambiguous.
- Your page must require minimal effort for users to immediately get or use what they are looking for.
- No user would require another result in order to be satisfied.
:::

### Highly Meets

The search result is helpful for **most** mobile users. Some other users may want to see more results.  

::: tip Characteristics of pages that highly satisfy a user's query:

- Content is [high quality](/qrg/page-quality-rating-guideline/4-high-quality-pages.html#characteristics-of-high-quality-pages)
- Content is accurate
- The author or business is [authoritative](/qrg/page-quality-rating-guideline/3-overall-page-quality-rating.html#expertise-authoritativeness-and-trustworthiness-e‑a‑t) for the topic
- Content is entertaining
- Content is new and recent (e.g., breaking news on a topic)
:::

### Moderately Meets

Your page moderately meets (moderately satisfies) a query when it is helpful for many users **OR** very helpful for some users. Some users would likely want to see more results.

::: warning Characteristics of pages that moderately satisfy a user's query:

- Content is less comprehensive, but not low-quality
- Content is not the most up-to-date, but also not out-of-date
- Site or author is not very authoritative
:::

### Slightly Meets

Helpful for only a few users. Many or most users would want to see more results.

::: warning Characteristics of pages that only slightly satisfy a user's query:

- The page satisfies a [minor interpretation](/qrg/needs-met-rating-guideline/16-rating-queries-with-multiple-interpretations-and-intents.html#rating-queries-with-multiple-interpretations-and-intents) of a query
- The page is [low quality](/qrg/page-quality-rating-guideline/6-low-quality-pages.html)
- The information is outdated
- Content is inaccurate
- Content is too specific
- Content is too broad
- Too niche for the general population
- The title is [misleading or exaggerated](/qrg/page-quality-rating-guideline/6-low-quality-pages.html#low-quality-main-content)
:::

### Fails to Meet

These pages completely fail to meet/satisfy the needs of users. All or almost all users would want to see more results.

::: danger Characteristics of pages that fail to satisfy a user's query:

- Content is factually incorrect
- Page is extremely low quality
- Content is very outdated
- Page is nearly impossible to use on a mobile device
- Page can harm users
  - Malicious downloads
  - Phishing pages
- Website impersonates another brand
- Content attempts to [deceive users](/qrg/page-quality-rating-guideline/7-lowest-quality-pages.html#deceptive-page-purpose)
  - Fake reviews
  - Fake news
- Provides inaccurate [YMYL information](/qrg/page-quality-rating-guideline/2-understanding-webpages-and-websites.html#your-money-or-your-life-ymyl-pages)
  - Inaccurate medical information
  - Inaccurate tax information
  - Inaccurate visa/green card information
- Non-pornographic page with pornographic ads
- Pages that contradict well-established scientific, medical, or historical consensus
:::

### The Relationship between E‑A‑T and Needs Met

If a page has [no useful purpose](/tldr/for-everyone.html#understanding-webpages-and-websites), it will not rank.

<div class="note">

[Website queries](/qrg/understanding-mobile-user-needs/12-understanding-mobile-users-queries-and-results.html#website-queries) are an exception to the rule above. However, those types of queries do not target new customers.

</div>

### Queries with Multiple Interpretations and Intents

The primary interpretation for a query will always rank highest.

For example, **most** users searching for <span class="query">[halo](https://www.google.com/search?q=halo)</span> in the U.S. are looking for information about the video game, and as such, pages about the video game will rank higher than pages about the [optical phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(optical_phenomenon)) or the [thing that floats over your head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(religious_iconography)).

### Needs Met Rating and Freshness

For queries about breaking news, recurring events, current information, or products, the newer the information is, the better.

### Rating Visit in Person Intent Queries

Google takes the type of entity (what you're searching for) into account when deciding how close "near me" should be. "Nearby" can mean completely different things depending on what the user is looking for. Test the following for examples:

- [gas station near me](https://www.google.com/search?q=gas+station+near+me)
- [theater near me](https://www.google.com/search?q=theater+near+me)
- [museums near me](https://www.google.com/search?q=museums+near+me)
- [national parks nearby](https://www.google.com/search?q=national+parks+nearby)

### Product Queries: Importance of Browsing and Researching
