# TL;DR for Everyone

Here we try to keep things as concise as possible, informing you about what to check your site for and which team needs to handle the problem if it isn't obvious.

> Disclaimer: The following content includes opinions and reasoning from the SEO professionals at [Bruce Clay Japan Inc.](https://bruceclay.jpn.com) These opinions and suggestions attempt to summarize Google's Quality Rater Guidelines, but are **not in any way** endorsed or backed by Google.

## General Guidelines Overview

Within Google's search results, pages are ranked based on two things:

1. **quality** of their info, and
2. **how well they satisfy the user's intent**

## Understanding Webpages and Websites

### Webpages

::: tip Focus on helping your users.
If you want a page to be ranked highly in a given category, focus first and foremost on **helping users** better than the competition.
:::

::: warning Your Money or Your Life (YMYL)
Pages which could potentially impact the future happiness, health, financial stability, or safety of users (YMYL pages) are judged more strictly.
:::

Example YMYL pages:

- Shopping or financial transaction pages
- Financial information pages
- Medical information pages
- Legal information pages
- News articles or public/official information pages important for having an informed citizenry
- Child Adoption
- Car Safety Information
- etc.

#### Parts of a Webpage

Some definitions from Google:

**Main Content (MC)**
: Any content on the page that **directly helps the page achieve its purpose** (product details on a product page, ingredients/measurements/directions on a recipe page, etc.).

**Supplementary Content (SC)**
: Any content that **is not** considered MC or Ads, but **affects (positively or negatively) user experience** (navigation links, related products, spammy comments, etc.).

**Identifying Advertisements/Monetization (Ads)**
: Ads is content and/or links that are displayed for the purpose of **monetizing the page**.

### Websites

Google will judge the reputation of a website based on a range of reputable independent sources (sites like [BBB](https://www.bbb.org/), [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/), etc.).

::: tip Be trustworthy.
Make it as easy as possible for Google to discover who (person/company) is responsible for the website, and who (person/company) created the content (for news/research/information-based pages).

In general, this implies a more trustworthy website overall.
:::  

::: tip Include contact information.
Depending on your type of business, Google expects different types and amounts of contact information. Contact information is very important for websites that handle money (stores, banks, credit card companies, etc.).
:::

#### Contact Info Suggestions

- Shopping Websites
  - Office Address
  - Email address
  - Phone number
  - Payment Policy
  - Exchange Policy
  - Return Policy
- Humor/Entertainment Websites
  - Office Address
  - Email address
- Personal Blogs
  - Email address/no contact info

### Reputation of the Website or Creator of the Main Content

::: tip Maintain a good reputation.
Make sure your company is (or you are) asking for reviews from satisfied customers and responding to negative reviews.
:::

If your company has (or you have) a bad reputation online, Google will be among the first to know, and your site can suffer as a result. This information is gathered and analyzed from many sources, including but not limited to:

- news articles
- Wikipedia articles
- blog posts
- magazine articles
- forum discussions
- ratings from independent organizations
- customer reviews

> For small businesses, having no reputation online is okay, it will **not** negatively affect your site.

::: tip Every user query has a goal.
The page that best answers a given query will rank highest. Keep the following in mind:

- The search intent for a given query can change over time (e.g. searching `iphone` in 2007 vs today)
  - Older pages become less relevant over time
- Queries can have multiple meanings (e.g. `apple`)
  - If the query has a dominant interpretation (the company "Apple Inc." for the example above), pages related to that interpretation will rank highest
:::

## Rating Using the Needs Met Scale

Search results are ranked based on how well they fulfill a user's query:

- **Fully Meets**  
A special category in which the search result is an exact match for the query. For example, if somebody in Japan is searching for `Bruce Clay Japan home page`, they are undoubtedly trying to get to [https://bruceclay.jpn.com/](https://bruceclay.jpn.com/).

- **Highly Meets**  
The search result is helpful for **most** mobile users. Some other users may want to see more results.

- **Moderately Meets**
Helpful for many users **OR** very helpful for some mobile users. Some or many other users may want to see more results.

- **Slightly Meets**
Helpful for only a few mobile users. Many or most users would want to see more results.

- **Fails to Meet**
Completely fails to meet the needs of mobile users. All or almost all users would want to see more results.
