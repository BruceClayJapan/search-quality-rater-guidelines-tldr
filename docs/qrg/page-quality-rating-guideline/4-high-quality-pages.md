# High Quality Pages

In this section, we will describe characteristics of **High** quality pages and give many examples. Examples help calibrate your ratings, so please review each one.

## Characteristics of High Quality Pages

**High** quality pages exist for almost any beneficial purpose, from giving information to making people laugh to expressing oneself artistically to purchasing products or services online.

What makes a **High** quality page? A **High** quality page should have a beneficial purpose and achieve that purpose well. In addition, **High** quality pages have the following characteristics:

- *High level of Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-A-T).*
- A satisfying amount of high quality MC, including a descriptive or helpful title.
- Satisfying website information and/or information about who is responsible for the website. If the page is primarily for shopping or includes financial transactions, then it should have satisfying customer service information.
- Positive website reputation for a website that is responsible for the MC on the page. Positive reputation of the creator of the MC, if different from that of the website.

## A Satisfying Amount of High Quality Main Content

The quality of the MC is one of the most important criteria in Page Quality rating, and informs the E-A-T of the page. For all types of webpages, creating high quality MC takes a significant amount of at least one of the following: time, effort, expertise, and talent/skill. For news articles and information pages, high quality MC must be factually accurate for the topic and must be supported by expert consensus where such consensus exists.

For each page you evaluate, spend a few minutes examining the MC before drawing a conclusion about it. Read the article, watch the video, examine the pictures, use the calculator, play the online game, etc. Remember that MC also includes page features and functionality, so test the page out. For example, if the page is a product page on a store website, put at least one product in the cart to make sure the shopping cart is functioning. If the page is an online game, spend a few minutes playing it.

The purpose of the page will help you determine what high quality content means for that page. For example, High quality information pages should be factually accurate, clearly written, and comprehensive. High quality shopping content should allow users to find the products they want and to purchase the products easily. High quality humor or satire should be entertaining, while factual accuracy is not a requirement as long as the page would be understood as satire by users.

The amount of content necessary for the page to be satisfying depends on the topic and purpose of the page. A **High** quality page on a broad topic with a lot of available information will have more content than a **High** quality page on a narrower topic. Here are some examples of pages with a satisfying amount of high quality MC.

Webpage|Discussion
---|---
[Siberian Husky Information Page](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//insidesearch/howsearchworks/assets/GG/SiberianHusky_Wikipedia.jpg)|The Siberian Husky (a breed of dog) is a narrow topic. Although this encyclopedia landing page has less MC than some encyclopedia pages on broader topics, it has a satisfying amount of clearly written, high quality MC.
[Kitchen Stand Mixer Shopping Page](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//insidesearch/howsearchworks/assets/GG/StandMixerTarget.jpg)|This shopping page on a reputable shopping website has a satisfying amount of high quality MC. The page provides the manufacturer's product specs, as well as original product information, over 90 user reviews, shipping and returns information, multiple images of the product, etc. Note: Some of the MC is behind links on the page ("item details," "item specifications," "guest reviews," etc.). Even though you have to click these links to see the content, it is still considered MC.
[Movie Review Page](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//insidesearch/howsearchworks/assets/GG/MovieReviewNYT.jpg)|This movie review written by a movie critic has a satisfying amount of high quality MC. Time, effort, and talent/skill went into writing this movie review.

## Clear and Satisfying Website Information: Who is Responsible and Customer Service

Understanding who is responsible for a website is a critical part of assessing E-A-T for most types of websites. High quality pages should have clear information about the website so that users feel comfortable trusting the site.

The amount of information needed for E-A-T assessment depends on the type of website. For example, YMYL websites demand a high degree of trust, so they generally need satisfying information about who is responsible for the content of the site. In addition, High quality stores and financial transaction websites also need clear and satisfying customer service information to help users resolve issues.

Other websites that are not YMYL websites may need less website information, depending on the purpose of the website. For example, an email address may be sufficient for some non-YMYL websites.

## Positive Reputation

Reputation is an important criteria when using the **High** rating, and informs the E-A-T of the page. While a page can merit the **High** rating with no reputation, the **High** rating cannot be used for any website that has a convincing negative reputation. Remember that when doing research, make sure to consider the reasons behind a negative rating and not just the rating itself.

## A High Level of Expertise/Authoritativeness/Trustworthiness (E-A-T)

**High** quality pages and websites need enough expertise to be authoritative and trustworthy on their topic. Remember that there are "expert" websites of all types, even gossip websites, fashion websites, humor websites, forum and Q&A pages, etc. In fact, some types of information are found almost exclusively on forums and discussions, where a community of experts can provide valuable perspectives on specific topics.

Think about the topic of the page. What kind of expertise is required for the page to achieve its purpose well? The standard for expertise depends on the topic of the page. For example, high quality news articles and information pages on scientific topics should represent established scientific consensus where such consensus exists.
