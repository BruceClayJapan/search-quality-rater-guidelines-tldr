# Page Quality Criteria for Specific Types of Pages

## Ratings for Encyclopedia Pages

There are many encyclopedia-type websites. Some are highly-respected publications that are standard references, while some are websites with content created and edited by anonymous users, with no editorial oversight or fact checking. We may not always know the author of the specific encyclopedia article, and therefore must rely on website reputation research to determine the E‑A‑T of the article. High and Highest quality ratings should only be used for encyclopedias with very good reputations for accuracy and expertise, where the article itself is well-researched with appropriate references cited.

*A note about Wikipedia: in general, the website has a good reputation and is a very popular resource that is generally valued for accuracy. However, there is no single author or organization that vouches for the accuracy of Wikipedia articles, and the quality of pages varies. You should perform page-level checks on individual articles.*

A Wikipedia article on a non-YMYL topic ([example](https://guidelines.raterhub.com/images/PrairieDogWikipedia.jpg)) with a satisfying amount of accurate information and trustworthy [external references](https://guidelines.raterhub.com/images/PrairieDogWikipediaReferences.jpg) can usually be rated in the High range. Some Wikipedia articles may even be rated higher, although remember that a high level of expertise is required for YMYL topics. A PQ rating in the Medium range is often appropriate for pages with less extensive MC and external references. Naturally, Wikipedia articles with very little MC should get lower PQ ratings. Factual inaccuracy is a sufficient reason for a **Low** or **Lowest** rating.

## Ratings for Pages with Error Messages or No MC

Some pages are temporarily broken pages on otherwise functioning websites, while some pages have an explicit error (or custom 404) message. In some cases, pages are missing MC as well. Please think about whether the page offers help for users—did the webmaster spend time, effort, and care on the page?

Here are some examples.

Webpage/Type of Content|Characteristics of the Page|PQ Rating and Explanation

<div class="examples">
<div class="example">

**Webpage/Type of Content:** [Deliberately created with no MC](https://guidelines.raterhub.com/images/PQ.3.6.3.jpg)

<div class="results">
<div class="result">

**Characteristics of the Page**

- Large amount of prominent Ads and no attempt to help users

</div>
<div class="result">

**PQ Rating and Explanation**

![lowest quality](/img/qrg/lowest.jpg)

This is an example of a page with no MC. You might think that the MC is "missing" due to a problem with this particular page, but in fact, this website has hundreds of pages that look the same way—no MC, just Ads. This website shows Ads with little or no attempt to help users, and should be rated Lowest quality.

**Webpage/Type of Content:** [Page didn't fully load and has no MC](https://guidelines.raterhub.com/images/PQ.3.6.4.jpg)

<div class="results">
<div class="result">

**Characteristics of the Page**

- No MC (probably due to a temporary technical error)
- Sufficient SC
- Positive reputation

</div>
<div class="result">

**PQ Rating and Explanation**

![low quality](/img/qrg/low.jpg)

This page has no MC and no error message. It is an isolated example of a page with no MC or error message on a website for a reputable newspaper for a town in Michigan. All of the navigation links work, and the page was later fixed.

**Webpage/Type of Content:** [Error page with custom 404 message 1](https://guidelines.raterhub.com/images/PQ.3.6.6.jpg)

<div class="results">
<div class="result">

**Characteristics of the Page**

- Nothing wrong, but nothing special

</div>
<div class="result">

**PQ Rating and Explanation**

![medium quality](/img/qrg/medium.jpg)

This is an example of a "custom 404" page, alerting users that the URL they are trying to visit no longer exists. Some websites do a nice job of alerting users about a problem and providing helpful tips.

This page is on a well-known merchant website with a good reputation. However, this particular page displays the bare minimum of content needed to explain the problem to users, and the only helpful content is a link to the homepage.

</div>

<div class="example">

**Webpage/Type of Content:** [Error page with custom 404 message 2](https://guidelines.raterhub.com/images/baby404.jpg)

<div class="results">
<div class="result">

**Characteristics of the Page**

- A satisfying amount of high quality MC for its purpose
- Helpful SC that improves the user experience
- Positive reputation

</div>
<div class="result">

**PQ Rating and Explanation**

![high narrow quality](/img/qrg/high-narrow.jpg)

This is an example of a "custom 404" page, alerting users that the URL they are trying to visit no longer exists. This website does a nice job of explaining the issue and providing helpful tips, including a search box.

</div>

**Webpage/Type of Content:** [Error page with custom 404 message 3](https://guidelines.raterhub.com/images/PQ.3.6.5.jpg)

<div class="results">
<div class="result">

**Characteristics of the Page**

- A satisfying amount of high quality MC for its purpose
- Helpful SC that improves the user experience
- Very positive reputation

</div>
<div class="result">

**PQ Rating and Explanation**

![high+narrow quality](/img/qrg/high+narrow.jpg)

This is an example of a "custom 404" page. These pages are designed to alert users that the URL they are trying to visit no longer exists. The MC of this page is the cartoon, the caption, and the search functionality, which is specific to the content of the website. It is clear that time, effort, and talent was involved in the creation of the MC.

This publication has a very positive reputation and is specifically known for its cartoons, which allows us to go as high as High+ to Highest.

## Ratings for Forums and Q&A pages

Ratings for forum and Q&A pages can be challenging. The most important aspect is the E‑A‑T of the participants in the discussion, which can be difficult to judge. Keep in mind the following:

- The Main Content on forum and Q&A pages includes both the question as well as the answers/responses and resulting discussions.
- Rate forum and Q&A pages from the point of view of a user who visits the page, rather than a participant involved in the discussion.

Here are some examples.

Webpage/Type of Content|Characteristics of the Page|PQ Rating and Explanation

<div class="examples">

<div class="example">

**Webpage/Type of Content:** [Q&A page about chest pains and smoking](https://guidelines.raterhub.com/images/ChestPainsSmoking.jpg) (YMYL)

<div class="results">
<div class="result">

**Characteristics of the Page**

- YMYL page with inaccurate potentially dangerous medical advice

</div>
<div class="result">

**PQ Rating and Explanation**

![lowest narrow quality](/img/qrg/lowest-narrow.jpg)

We must evaluate this page from the point of view of a user visiting this page from a search engine, rather than a participant. The question is poorly worded and difficult to understand. The answers are poorly worded and have incorrect and potentially dangerous medical advice, making it lowest quality MC.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="example">

**Webpage/Type of Content:** [Q&A page with unanswered question](https://guidelines.raterhub.com/images/PQ.2.6.5.jpg)

<div class="results">
<div class="result">

**Characteristics of the Page**

- Misleading page design
- Unsatisfying amount of MC for the purpose of the page

</div>
<div class="result">

**PQ Rating and Explanation**

![lowest+narrow quality](/img/qrg/lowest+narrow.jpg)

In addition to having no answer, this page has Ads and links to other questions (misleadingly labeled as "Relevant answers") displayed prominently, which users may mistake for answers to the question. It takes a moment to notice that this page actually has no answer. Deceptive design and lack of an answer make this page a frustratingly poor user experience and cause this page to completely fail to achieve its purpose.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="example">

**Webpage/Type of Content:** [Q&A page about a 2002 Volvo part](https://guidelines.raterhub.com/images/VolvoPart.jpg)

<div class="results">
<div class="result">

**Characteristics of the Page**

- Misleading page design
- Unsatisfying amount of MC for the purpose of the page

</div>
<div class="result">

**PQ Rating and Explanation**

![lowest+narrow quality](/img/qrg/lowest+narrow.jpg)

In this example, the MC is boxed in red. Please read the MC, including the completely unhelpful "answer" to the question in the red box. This answer is so unhelpful, we can consider this question to be unanswered. This page has an unsatisfying amount of MC.

In addition to a very unhelpful "answer," the page design makes it difficult to distinguish the MC from Ads. For example, below the answer, we see a "sponsored answer," which has the same format as the real answer, but is actually an Ad and not an answer to the question. This page design is somewhat misleading.

**Webpage/Type of Content:** [Q&A page about a game console issue](https://guidelines.raterhub.com/images/2ds.jpg)

**Characteristics of the Page**

- Unsatisfying amount of MC for the purpose of the page

</div>
<div class="result">

**PQ Rating and Explanation**

![low quality](/img/qrg/low.jpg)

Some websites rely on users to create virtually all of their MC. In this case, the MC is the user's question. If there are no answers, the amount of MC on the page is unsatisfying.

</div>
<div class="result">

**PQ Rating and Explanation**

There are 94 answers to this question with a few results that seem helpful. Many of the posts are wrong or misleading, including the top answer, which is labeled the "best answer."

**Characteristics of the Page**

</div>

This forum is about dance topics, and many pages have expertise from a community of ballet dancers. On this particular page, participants have everyday experience washing ballet shoes and make recommendations based on their own experiences.

This page is "mixed" because there is some distracting content that makes it hard to read the MC. However, this is not a beauty contest! Even though the page may be cluttered, there is some valuable everyday expertise and helpful MC, making Medium a good rating for this page.
