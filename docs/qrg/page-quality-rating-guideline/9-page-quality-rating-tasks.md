# Page Quality Rating Tasks

At first, PQ rating may seem difficult. There are several aspects of the page and the website to look at and think about. This type of rating takes practice. Rereading sections of these guidelines and thinking about the examples may help when you encounter difficult rating tasks.

**Important:** Do not struggle with each PQ rating. Please give your best rating and move on. If you are having trouble deciding between two ratings, use the lower rating. If you are torn between three ratings, choose the one in the middle.

Do not consider the country or location of the page or website for PQ rating. For example, English (US) raters should use the same PQ standards when rating pages from other English language websites (UK websites, Canadian websites, etc.)
as they use when rating pages from U.S. websites. In other words, English (US) raters should not lower the PQ rating because the page location (UK, Canada) does not match the task location.

These guidelines are specific to "regular" webpages. Occasionally, you may be asked to rate a landing page that is not a webpage. For example, you may be asked to rate a PDF file, a PNG or JPEG image file, etc. When the landing page of the URL is not a webpage, some of the criteria in these guidelines may not apply. In this case, please use your judgment.

Finally, this Page Quality Rating Guideline does not completely cover every aspect of page quality. If you find pages that you truly believe to be **High** or **Low** quality, please rate them as such, even if the reason is based on something not covered in this document. Please use the comment section to explain your reasoning. As always, use your judgment.

## Instructions for Rating Page Quality Tasks

**The Page Quality task page is broken up into several parts:**

1. Some initial questions about the task landing page.
2. A "PQ grid" to record your observations about PQ characteristics of the landing page.
3. The Overall PQ rating slider which records your Overall PQ rating.
4. A comment box to explain your rating.

Some results to the initial questions will end the task early. If the page is Porn, Foreign Language, or Did Not Load, you will not fill in the PQ grid or assign an overall rating.

- Foreign Language should be used when the language on the landing page is NOT the task language, a language that is commonly used by a significant percentage of the population in the task location, or English.
- Did Not Load should be used for pages where there is absolutely no content on the page created by the website. There is no MC, SC, or Ads on the page. See this [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) for descriptions of different types of error messages.

Similarly, if you respond that the page is malicious, harmful, deceptive, or lacking in purpose, you will also not fill in the PQ grid or assign an overall rating.

The PQ grid is designed to be your "note pad." It allows you to record your observations about the landing page and the website it belongs to.

### Rating on Your Phone

You should open the task landing page on your phone using the standard Send to Device feature, unless otherwise instructed. However, more intensive analysis on the website can be done on your computer. For example, you should open and explore the links that are provided to help you do research on website information and reputation on your computer.

**Important:** Clicking on the task URL may bring up an interstitial page. You can ignore this page in your rating criteria if you can easily get to the MC. However, if the interstitial page makes it extremely hard (or impossible) to get to the MC, that should factor into your Page Quality rating.

## Reputation and E-A-T: Website or the Creators of the Main Content?

You must consider the reputation and E-A-T of both the website and the creators of the MC in order to assign a Page Quality rating.

The reputation and E-A-T of the creators of the MC is extremely important when a website has different authors or content creators on different pages. This is true of forum and Q&A pages, news websites, or websites that have user-generated content, such as YouTube, Twitter, etc. The reputation and E-A-T assessment for pages on these types of websites may differ drastically depending on what page you are evaluating. There are **Highest** quality YouTube videos created by highly reputable and expert content creators, as well as **Lowest** quality YouTube videos created with a dangerous lack of E-A-T on YMYL topics.

**Important:** Research the reputation and E-A-T of both the website and the creators of the MC. If either are lacking for the purpose of the page, the **Low** or **Lowest** rating is appropriate.
