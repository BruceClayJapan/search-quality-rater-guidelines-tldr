# Simplified Needs Met Tasks

Some Needs Met rating tasks may not require ratings for all blocks. In these blocks, the Needs Met and E‑A‑T rating scales will be greyed out and annotated with the text "No Rating Required".

The greyed-out results (sometimes referred to as "contextual results") are shown to help you understand the query and inform your ratings. You can click on them when you feel like they will be helpful in determining your ratings.

Here is an example:
