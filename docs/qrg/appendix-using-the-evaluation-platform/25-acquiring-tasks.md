# Acquiring Tasks

Here is a simplified screenshot of the task acquisition page on the Evaluation Platform. Please note that changes are sometimes made to the appearance of this page, so it may not look exactly as it appears below.

A few notes about how to acquire tasks from this page:

- **rater@gmail.com:** Make sure you are logged in to the account you used to sign up for the rating program.

- **Acquire if available:** Click this button to acquire a new task.

- **Headphones or speakers required:** This label indicates that the task requires headphones or speakers (for example, to listen to an audio file).

  Please note you may see other types of labels next to the button on the task acquisition page. Sometimes there will be only one button, while other times you may see more than one button displayed to distinguish tasks with different requirements. When there is more than one displayed, you may choose the one you want to acquire.
