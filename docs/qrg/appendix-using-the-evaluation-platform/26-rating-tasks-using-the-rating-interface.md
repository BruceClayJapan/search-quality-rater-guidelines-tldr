# Rating Tasks Using the Rating Interface

Here is a general outline of the steps you should follow upon acquiring a task:

1. **Read the instructions:** Pay close attention to any project-specific instructions and examples if provided.
2. **Fill out the task:** Assign ratings to result blocks, provide comments, answer questions, etc. (as applicable).
3. **Check your work:** Verify that you entered your ratings as intended. Additionally, make sure that you provided a esponse to all required questions.
4. **Submit the task:** Click the "Submit" button at the end of the page to submit the task and continue rating. lternatively, click "Submit and Stop Rating" to submit the task and return to the Evaluation Platform homepage.

Additionally, here are a few general things to keep in mind when rating tasks:

- **Result blocks are sometimes slow to load:** Before assigning any ratings, please scan the task page to make sure that all result blocks have loaded. Please note that result blocks may be slow to load and/or that the task page may need reloading if there are empty result blocks. If the result blocks fail to load after refreshing a few times, please release the task by following the instructions in the [next section](./27-releasing-tasks) (Releasing Tasks).

- **Sometimes a side will not have any result blocks:** If one side displays the message "This side did not generate any results," please do not release the task.

- **Do not refresh the task page after assigning ratings:** If you refresh the page after assigning ratings, you will lose them and they will have to be entered again.
