# Product Queries: Importance of Browsing and Researching

Some product queries, such as `ipad reviews`, have a clear information-seeking (**Know**) intent. Other product queries, such as `buy ipad`, have a clear purchase (**Do**) intent. And some product queries, such as `ipad store.apple.com`, have a clear navigation (**Website**) intent. However, most product queries don't obviously specify one type of intent.

Keep in mind that many users enjoy browsing and visually exploring products online, similar to window shopping in real life. Give high Needs Met ratings to results that allow users to research, browse, and decide what to purchase.

Users may not always plan to buy products online that they are browsing and researching, for example, cars or major appliances. Even though the ultimate goal may be to purchase a product, many other activities may take place first: researching the product (reviews, technical specifications), understanding the options that are available (brands, models, pricing), viewing and considering various options (browsing), etc.

**Important:** Page Quality ratings for product results need extra care and attention.

Often, the results for product queries are YMYL pages. Users need high quality information from authoritative sources when researching products, especially when products are expensive or represent a major investment/important life event (e.g., cars, washing machines, computers, wedding gifts, baby products, hurricane shutters, large fitness equipment). When buying products, users need websites they can trust: good reputation, extensive customer service support, etc. Results for product queries may be important for both your money and your life (YMYL)!
