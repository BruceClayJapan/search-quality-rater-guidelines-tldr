# The Relationship between E-A-T and Needs Met

The Needs Met rating is based on _both_ the query and the result. You must carefully think about the query and user intent when assigning a Needs Met rating.

The E-A-T rating slider does _not_ depend on the query. Do not think about the query when assigning a E-A-T rating to the LP.

Some results don’t have a E-A-T slider. If a result block has no E-A-T rating slider, you do not have to give a E-A-T rating. If there is a E-A-T slider, please assign a E-A-T rating based on the landing page. If you are unable to evaluate the E-A-T rating of a **Foreign Language** or **Did Not Load** result, you should assign a **Medium** rating.

Here is some guidance about assigning Needs Met and E-A-T ratings:

- Useless results should always be rated **FailsM**, even if the landing page has a high E-A-T rating. Useless is useless.

- On-topic, helpful, but low E-A-T results should get lower Needs Met ratings than on-topic, helpful, and high E-A-T results. The Needs Met scale encompasses all aspects of "helpfulness," and many users find low E-A-T results less helpful than high E-A-T results. Your ratings should reflect this.

- The **HM** rating should be given to helpful, high Page Quality pages that are a good fit for the query. The **HM** rating may also be used for results that are very helpful, medium quality, and have other very desirable characteristics, such as very recent information.

- The **HM** rating may not be appropriate if a page has low Page Quality or has any other undesirable characteristic, such as outdated or inaccurate information, or if it is a poor fit for the query. We have very high standards for the **HM** rating.

- SM is often an appropriate rating for low quality but on-topic pages. However, a page can have such low Page Quality that it is useless for nearly all queries. Gibberish pages are a good example of pages with low Page Quality that should be rated FailsM. An exception to this is queries with clear website intent, where the target website should be rated FullyM even if the page has low Page Quality.

- Remember that if a page lacks a beneficial purpose, it should always be rated Lowest Page Quality ­ regardless of the page’s Needs Met rating or how well­-designed the page may be. Please review [Lowest Quality Pages](../page-quality-rating-guideline/7-lowest-quality-pages) for a summary of other types of Lowest Page Quality pages.
