# Specificity of Queries and Landing Pages

Some queries are very general and some queries are specific. Here are some examples that compare levels of specificity of English (US) queries:

- **Query**
  - **More Specific Query**
    - **Even More Specific Query**
- <span class="query">chair</span>
  - <span class="query">dining room chair</span>
    - <span class="query">ikea "henriksdal" highback upholstered chair</span>
- <span class="query">library</span>
  - <span class="query">harvard library</span>
    - <span class="query">harvard anthropology library</span>
- <span class="query">interview questions</span>
  - <span class="query">interview questions for teachers</span>
    - <span class="query">practice interview questions used for teach for america</span>
- <span class="query">restaurants</span>
  - <span class="query">chinese restaurants</span>
    - <span class="query">takeout chinese restaurants in downtown Austin</span>
- <span class="query">coffee shops</span>
  - <span class="query">starbucks</span>
    - <span class="query">red rock coffee mountain view</span>

Results for specific queries are easier to rate on the Needs Met scale because we know more about what the user is looking for. Giving a Needs Met rating for results for general queries can be difficult. As always, your rating is based on how helpful the result is for the query, not the specificity fit.

When the query is a broad category, such as <span class="query">cafes</span>, <span class="query">restaurants</span>, <span class="query">hotels</span>, <span class="query">books</span>, <span class="query">tourist attractions in paris</span>, etc., popular and prominent examples may be considered very helpful. Please do web research to help you understand what is popular and prominent in different locations.
