# Introduction to Search Quality Rating

The World Wide Web is a vast collection of online information and content. Internet search engines provide a powerful way to explore this online universe. There are many ways people search: people may type words into a search box in a browser, speak to a mobile phone or assistant device, use search engine autocomplete features, etc.

People search the Internet for a variety of purposes, ranging from accomplishing a quick task to researching a topic in depth. A search may be part of a long-term project, such as a home remodel or vacation planning. A search may be done when someone is bored and looking for entertainment, such as a search for <span class="query">funny videos</span>. A search may be a single question asked during a critical moment of a person's life, such as <span class="query">what are the symptoms of a heart attack?</span>.

Search engines exist to help people find what they are looking for. To do that, search engines must provide a diverse set of helpful, high quality search results, presented in the most helpful order.

Different types of searches need very different types of search results. Medical search results should be high quality, authoritative, and trustworthy. Search results for <span class="query">cute baby animal pictures</span> should be adorable. Search results for a specific website or webpage should have that desired result at the top. Searches that have many possible meanings or involve many perspectives need a diverse set of results that reflect the natural diversity of meanings and points of view.

People all over the world use search engines; therefore, diversity in search results is essential to satisfy the diversity of people who use search. For example, searches about groups of people should return helpful results that represent a diversity of demographic backgrounds and cultures.

Finally, search results should help people. Search results should provide authoritative and trustworthy information, not lead people astray with misleading content. Search results should allow people to find what they're looking for, not surprise people with unpleasant, upsetting, offensive, or disturbing content. Harmful, hateful, violent, or sexually explicit search results are only appropriate if the person phrased their search in a way that makes it clear that they are looking for this type of content, **_and_** there is no other reasonable interpretation of the words used in their search.

## The Purpose of Search Quality Rating

Your ratings will be used to evaluate search engine quality around the world. Good search engines give results that are helpful for users in their specific language and locale.

It is important that you are familiar with and comfortable using a search engine. We encourage you to be an expert in Google search! For example, experiment with using operators (e.g., quotes or a dash) in your searches or try using Google's advanced search option.

## Raters Must Represent People in Their Rating Locale

It is very important for you to represent users in the locale you evaluate. You must be very familiar with the task language and location in order to represent the experience of users in your locale. If you do not have the knowledge to do this, please inform your employer/company.

Unless your rating task indicates otherwise, your ratings should be based on the instructions and examples given in these guidelines. Ratings should not be based on your personal opinions, preferences, religious beliefs, or political views. Always use your best judgment and represent the cultural standards and norms of your rating locale.

## Browser Requirements

Check with your employer/company for browser requirements. You may use helpful browser add-ons or extensions, but please do not use add-ons or extensions that interfere with or alter the user experience of the page.

## Ad Blocking Extensions

Do not use add-ons or extensions that block ads for Needs Met rating or Page Quality rating. These add-ons or extensions may cause you to give incorrect ratings. As a rater, only use an ad blocking extension or add-on if specifically instructed to do so in the project-specific instructions.

## Internet Safety Information

In the course of your work, you will visit many different webpages. Some of them may harm your computer unless you are careful. Please do not download any executables, applications, or other potentially dangerous files, or click on any links that you are uncomfortable with.

**It is strongly recommended that you have antivirus and antispyware protection on your computer. This software must be updated frequently or your computer will not be protected. There are many free and for-purchase antivirus and antispyware products available on the web.**

See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software) for a Wikipedia page on antivirus software and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware) for a Wikipedia page on spyware.

We suggest that you only open files with which you are comfortable. The file formats listed below are generally considered safe if antivirus software is in place.

- `.txt` (text file)
- `.ppt` or `.pptx` (Microsoft PowerPoint)
- `.doc` or `.docx` (Microsoft Word)
- `.xls` or `.xlsx` (Microsoft Excel)
- `.pdf` (PDF) files

If you encounter a page with a warning message, such as "Warning-visiting this web site may harm your computer," or if your antivirus software warns you about a page, you should not try to visit the page to assign a rating.

You may also encounter pages that require RealPlayer or the Adobe Flash plug-in. These are generally safe to download.
