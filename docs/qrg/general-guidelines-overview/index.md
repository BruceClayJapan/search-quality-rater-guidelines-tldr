# General Guidelines Overview

## Welcome to the Search Quality Rating Program!

As a Search Quality Rater, you will work on many different types of rating projects. The General Guidelines primarily cover Page Quality (PQ) rating and Needs Met (NM) rating; however, the concepts are also important for many other types of rating tasks.

For brevity, we refer to "Search Quality Raters" as "raters" in these guidelines.
