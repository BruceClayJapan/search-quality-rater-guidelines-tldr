# Introduction to Search Quality Rating

## The Purpose of Search Quality Rating

Your ratings will be used to evaluate search engine quality around the world. Good search engines give results that are helpful for users in their specific language and locale.

It is important that you are familiar with and comfortable using a search engine. We encourage you to be an expert in Google search! For example, experiment with using operators (e.g., quotes or a dash) in your searches or try using Googleâ€™s advanced search option.

## Raters Must Represent the User

It is very important for you to represent users in the locale you evaluate. You must be very familiar with the task language and location in order to represent the experience of users in your locale. If you do not have the knowledge to do this, please inform your employer/company.

## Browser Requirements

Check with your employer/company for browser requirements. You may use helpful browser add-ons or extensions, but please do not use add-ons or extensions that interfere with or alter the user experience of the page.

## Ad Blocking Extensions

Do not use add-ons or extensions that block ads for Needs Met rating or Page Quality rating. These add-ons or extensions may cause you to give incorrect ratings. As a rater, only use an ad blocking extension or add-on if specifically instructed to do so in the project-specific instructions.

## Internet Safety Information

In the course of your work, you will visit many different webpages. Some of them may harm your computer unless you are careful. Please do not download any executables, applications, or other potentially dangerous files, or click on any links that you are uncomfortable with.

**It is strongly recommended that you have antivirus and antispyware protection on your computer. This software must be updated frequently or your computer will not be protected. There are many free and for-purchase antivirus and antispyware products available on the web**.

See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software) for a Wikipedia page on antivirus software and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware) for a Wikipedia page on spyware.

We suggest that you only open files with which you are comfortable. The file formats listed below are generally considered safe if antivirus software is in place.

- `.txt` (text file)
- `.ppt` or `.pptx` (Microsoft PowerPoint)
- `.doc` or `.docx` (Microsoft Word)
- `.xls` or `.xlsx` (Microsoft Excel)
- `.pdf` (PDF) files

If you encounter a page with a warning message, such as "Warning-visiting this web site may harm your computer," or if your antivirus software warns you about a page, you should not try to visit the page to assign a rating.

You may also encounter pages that require RealPlayer or the Adobe Flash plug-in. These are generally safe to download.
