# Rating English Language Results in Non-English Locales

<span style="color: red">**The following rating guidance is for raters in non-English locales. You may stop reading this section if your task language is English, such as English (US), English (IN), English (NG), etc.**</span>

Your Needs Met ratings should reflect how helpful the result is for users in your locale. When the query is in the language of your locale, assume that users want results in that language. We know that **you** can read English (you are reading this document!), but you should only give high Needs Met ratings to English results if users in your locale would expect or want them for a particular query. Unless requested by the query, English results should be considered useless if most users in the locale can't read them.

However, rating can be more difficult when the query includes English names, words, etc., or when it's unclear whether English results would be satisfying for a particular query. Please use your judgment and knowledge of your locale to determine the appropriate rating.

**Important:** Please keep in mind that every locale will have unique considerations regarding the number and variety of languages (such as official languages, regional languages, local dialects, etc.), writing systems, and keyboard input languages commonly in use. While this guideline may not include examples for your locale, it is important that you represent users in your task location and culture in order to interpret the query and rate results. When in doubt, please assume that users would prefer results in the task language unless the query clearly indicates otherwise.

## Examples of English (and Non-English) Results in Non-English Locales

The section includes some examples using Hindi (IN) and Korean (KR) as the locales. In both cases, we cannot assume that users in these locales—i.e., Hindi-speaking users in India, or Korean-speaking users in Korea—are able to read English. Unless most users in the locale would be satisfied by English results for the query, we will consider them unhelpful or even useless (**FailsM**).

On the other hand, there may be queries where the needs of most users would actually be satisfied by English language results, even if the query itself is typed in the task language.

For example, for queries about global businesses and organizations, users may expect or want to visit the English language version of the business/organization's official website in some locales. Similarly, for queries seeking technical information such as manufacturer part numbers, product specs, scientific or chemical formulas, etc., the answer to the query may be typically expressed in the English language in some locales.

For these queries, users may expect or want to see English results in order to satisfy their need. Please use your judgment and knowledge of your locale to determine the appropriate rating.
