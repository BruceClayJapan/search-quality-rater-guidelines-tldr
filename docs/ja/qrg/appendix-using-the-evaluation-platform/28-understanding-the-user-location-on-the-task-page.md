# Understanding the User Location on the Task Page

The location of the user should be inferred from the map provided. The map can help clarify where the user was physically located when the query was issued.

On the map, the user location can be precise (blue dot), approximate (blue rectangle or circle), or missing altogether if the user location is unknown. Here are some examples of what you might see at the top of the task:

![](../images/img856.jpg)|A precise user location is represented by a blue dot:<br>![](../images/img857.jpg)|![](../images/img859.jpg)|Sometimes you will see a shaded blue circle around the blue dot. The blue dot is the user's most likely location, but it is possible they are located anywhere within the larger shaded blue region.
![](../images/img860.jpg)|The user can be located anywhere within the blue rectangle on the map.|![](../images/img861.jpg)|The map includes a response pin, which is a marker for a visit-in-person result block in the task. If there are three visit-in-person result blocks in the task, there should be three response pins on the map.
