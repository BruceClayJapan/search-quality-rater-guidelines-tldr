# Medium Quality Pages

In this section, we will describe pages that should get the **Medium** quality rating. **Medium** pages have a beneficial purpose and achieve their purpose.

There are two types of **Medium** quality pages:

Type of Medium Page|Discussion
---|---
**Nothing wrong, but nothing special**|The page achieves its purpose, however, it does not merit a **High** quality rating, nor is there anything to indicate that a **Low** quality rating is appropriate.
**Mixed with strong High quality rating characteristics**|The page or website has strong **High** quality rating characteristics, but also has mild **Low** quality characteristics. The strong **High** quality aspects make it difficult to rate the page **Low**.
